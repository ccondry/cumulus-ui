Each and every time I call Cumulus my issues are resolved. In addition, getting an expert on the phone within minutes is impressive. Typically, you work with 1st level customer service people, then they escalate an issue and time is wasted and lost with nearly every company I have ever dealt with. With Cumulus, time is money and it is obvious that you get that as issues are resolved quickly and accurately!!!",

I have enjoyed using Cumulus for the past 6 years and do my best to have it used where ever I work. I am writing to you today to let you know that your support team is one of the best I have interacted with. Even with me being in a unsupported environment your team is always willing to help me get through my issues. I would particularly like to call Sandra Jefferson out for going above and beyond to help me in my times of need. Coming from support I recognize that most people are quick to condemn, and not very quick to say thank you. Please pass a BIG THANK YOU on to your support team from myself and the rest of my team.",

He has answered my questions thoroughly, quickly and politely even when the question was simple or seemed stupid. In this day and age it is hard to find a real person to talk to in support and if you do they typically do not speak very good English. I appreciate the fantastic support and the ability to talk with a professional English speaking agent.",
